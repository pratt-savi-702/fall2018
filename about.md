[Pratt SAVI](https://commons.pratt.edu/savi/) 702--Introduction to GIS: QGIS--is an introduction to the GIS using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/).

Students were asked to create final projects using techniques covered in the
course on a topic of interest, whether that interest was personal or for future
research. We're excited to share the end products with you, which explore a
diverse span of locations, topic areas, and mapping techniques.
